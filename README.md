  <h2 style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:20px;">FAKING IT</h2>

  <p>We no longer touch —<br>
  we just tap.</p>

  <p>We no longer speak —<br>
  we type.</p>

  <p>Our hearts beat in notifications,<br>
  our worth measured in blue ticks.</p>

  <p>We traded warmth for Wi-Fi,<br>
  love for likes,<br>
  and called it connection.</p>

  <p>Eyes glow in the dark,<br>
  faces fade behind filters,<br>
  truth dies under captions<br>
  written for applause.</p>

  <p>We are ghosts in pixels,<br>
  haunting each other’s screens.</p>

  <p>See them —<br>
  perfect smiles, perfect lives,<br>
  all edited pain beneath a viral frame.<br>
  The world scrolls by like a funeral parade,<br>
  everyone clapping,<br>
  no one caring.</p>

  <p>We post grief with emojis,<br>
  we mourn with hashtags,<br>
  we heal by pretending we’re fine.<br>
  We mirror the world back to itself —<br>
  empty, polished,<br>
  terrified of silence.</p>

  <p>Then one day,<br>
  the battery dies.<br>
  The screen goes black.</p>

  <p>No followers.<br>
  No likes<br>
  No one watching.<br>
  Just you —<br>
  and the emptiness you called life.<br>
  Your reflection stares back<br>
  from the dead glass,<br>
  and whispers softly,</p>

  <p><em>“You were never connected.”</em></p>
