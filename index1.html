      <h2>Preface: The Language Beneath the Skin</h2>
      <p>
        I wrote these words for the broken —<br>
        for those who do not speak but still bleed syllables beneath silence.<br>
        The world speaks in daylight; I write in the blackout.
      </p>
      <p>
        These poems are not written in your tongue.<br>
        They are spoken in fractures, mirrored through illusion,<br>
        and buried in silence.<br>
        What follows is not language — it is infection, memory, and signal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here lies the lexicon —<br>
        Words that once had meaning,<br>
        then died,<br>
        and learned to haunt.
      </p>

      <h2>⚡ I. Fractured</h2>
      <p><em>(The beginning of pain — where betrayal is born and decay becomes beautiful.)</em></p>
      <p>
        &gt; Glassblood — the fragile rage that cuts like light.<br>
        Faithrust — the corrosion of belief.<br>
        Echoweed — thoughts that grow back no matter how often you kill them.<br>
        Soulstatic — the noise between heartbeats.<br>
        Truthshard — honesty sharp enough to wound.<br>
        (And others like them — fragments of a mind once whole.)
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>🪞 II. Mirrored</h2>
      <p><em>(The realm of illusion — where hypocrisy dresses as light and reflection lies.)</em></p>
      <p>
        &gt; Silenscript — breath written on glass, unread confessions.<br>
        Ghostware — presence without existence.<br>
        Masklight — the glow that hides rot.<br>
        Haloerror — purity that glitched.<br>
        Glassveil — transparent deceit.
      </p>
      <p>Here, the mirror doesn’t show truth — it shows who you pretend to be.</p>

      <h2>⚫ III. Blackout</h2>
      <p><em>(The end — where language collapses and silence devours memory.)</em></p>
      <p>
        &gt; Nullsoul — the ghost of a self that once cared.<br>
        Quietrot — decay beneath a calm face.<br>
        Deadlight — the memory of light after hope dies.<br>
        Coremute — silence so deep it erases thought.<br>
        Endscript — the final line written after meaning bleeds away.
      </p>
      <p>No light survives here — only pulse, void, and memory.</p>
      <p>If you still understand these words, you have not yet become one of them.</p>

      <h2>Author’s Note</h2>
      <p>The Lexicon came first. The Poems grew from it like wounds remembering their source.</p>
